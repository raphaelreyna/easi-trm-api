# EASI - The Right Move API Go Client

This repo is home to both an unofficial Go client for the [EASI - The Right Move API](https://www.easidemographics.com/MobileApp/APIInfo.asp) and an unofficial [gateway](https://github.com/raphaelreyna/easi-trm-api/tree/master/cmd/easi-trm-gateway) for those who wish to use JSON.
I am in no way affiliated with EASI, other than as a user of their API.

From the [EASI page for The Right Move API](https://www.easidemographics.com/MobileApp/APIInfo.asp):
> The Right Move API is designed to let you generate applications which assist in location, neighborhood, and site evaluation.
> This ground-breaking API will allow you to offer prospective homeowners, realtors, brokers, and anyone evaluating a location, key current neighborhood demographics.
> Using EASI's industry tested report engines, this API will allow developers to generate updated an demographic summary of the area around a user specified set of coordinates (in the US only), with a radius between .05 and 10 miles.

## Gateway Service

Check out the [gateway service](https://github.com/raphaelreyna/easi-trm-api/tree/master/cmd/easi-trm-gateway) that enables developers to consume the EASI -The Right Move API using JSON rather than SOAP!
